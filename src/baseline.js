 * possible thing to return here: on screen it reads as a parcel that lost none
 * of its forest — pristine, perfectly protected — when what actually happened is
 * that the measurement is unavailable. An error that points that direction
 * flatters the project under scrutiny, which is the one direction this tool must
 * never fail in.
 *
 * Two footprints in the shipped pool hit it. Tucumã and Castanheira have prior
 * clearing recorded as larger than their own land area — the bounding-box
 * straddling artefact the README documents — so their 2008 forest computes to
 * zero and every later ratio divides by it. The Python engine already refuses
 * these units in `_validate_treated_unit`; this is the same refusal for the app,
 * so the two sides of the project cannot disagree about which parcels are
 * measurable.
